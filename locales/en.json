    "help.desc6": "This generates a searchable inventory database linked with location and contact information which can be used to complete and experiment or procedure while you are waiting on a reagent or chemical to arrive or if you wish to try a product before you buy it.

    "help.desc7": "This web app will also <b>reduce institution wide emails</b> requesting a reagent or help, allow people to use LabYoke as a <b>social interface</b>. The most important feature is that it can be used to <b>reduce purchasing prices</b>. A number of lab chemicals and reagents have an expiration date, and this will allow enzymes and perishable products to be used to completion through sharing. You can also use this web app to help identify items that you might want to consider buying in bulk to reduce shipping fees, or buying a larger quantity and sharing the reagent or chemical amongst the department. Lastly having an uploaded searchable database can also be used by environmental health and safety teams to <b>identify potentially hazardous chemicals</b> and biological reagents and link these purchases with a location.",
