New shares are highlighted in light blue.<br/><br/>If for any reason, you are unable to fulfill the order, you can click on the checkbox under the <b><i>X</i></b> column to send an email to the requestor and cancel the order. Cancelled orders are highlighted in light bronze.<br/><br/><b>Your Reagents uploaded by your administrators</b><br/>Your administrator is charged with replenishing your reagent inventory in LabYoke. <br/>If you are running low on inventory for a reagent, click on the checkbox under the <b><i>X</i></b> column. Checked reagents will not be displayed in any search results and thus cannot be ordered. You can always re-instate the reagent by checking it again.<br/><br/>Tables can be searched and sorted.<br/><br/><b>Operational Charts</b><br/>A list of charts is available to visualize the data generated by the shared data.<br/><br/><b>Admin Upload</b><br/>Administrators are tasked with uploading the inventory for all researchers in their department. This tool can be used to upload an xcel spreadsheet and replenish/create reagents for reseachers.",
